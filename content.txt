GETTING LOUD FOR OUR BOYS The challenges that many children face can
          feel overwhelming. Societal norms teach girls that it is OK for them
          to express their feelings; however, these norms teach boys that "real
          men are tough and don't show ther emotions. And unexpressed anger,
          sadness, fear or frustration may have negative repercussions on a
          young boy's behaviour, mental health and development. Symptoms of
          mental illness in boys may look like "typical teenager" behaviour,
          leaving mental illness unnoticed for many years. Symptoms of mental
          illness may include risky behaviou substance abuse conflict with
          others or the law - impulsivity inability to focus WHAT CAN WE DO?
          Teach boys to take care of themselves-if we teach young boys healthy
          coping skills and self-care practices, they will be better prepared to
          recognize unhealthy thoughts and behaviours as teenagers and as
          adults. Early intervention-Catching the signs of mental illness early
          and providing treatment can empower both boys and girls and increase
          the quality of their lives throughout their lives Change the
          message-Let's change the messages men and boys receive so they can
          learn some new lessons. Let's show them that: It's OK for boys and men
          to express their emotions. It's necessary for boys and men to take
          care of themselves. Work-life balance is important for men too.
          Success can be defined by their own criteria, which may include mental
          health, healthy relationships and happiness. RESOURCES While family
          and friends are important supports, there are other sources of
          information and inspiration that can help.. Websites of reputable
          mental health organizations such as CMHA Books about mental health
